            <p>Love of my life, you've hurt me
                You've broken my heart, and now you leave me
                Love of my life, can't you see?
                Bring it back, bring it back
                Don't take it away from me
                Because you don't know
                What it means to me
                Love of my life, don't leave me
                You've taken my love, and now desert me
                Love of my life, can't you see?
                Bring it back, bring it back
                Don't take it away from me
                Because you don't know
                What it means to me
                You will remember
                When this is blown over
                And everything's all by the way
                When I grow older
                I will be there at your side to remind you
                How I still love you (I still love you)
                Back, hurry back
                Please, bring it back home to me
                Because you don't know
                What it means to me
                Love of my life
                Love of my life
                Ooh, ooh
